## Installing packages

The most common methods for installing packages are to use:
the tool provided with your Python editor
the pip/pip3 command line utility which is included with a full Python install
an operating system specific installer provided by the package creators, such as a windows installer or debian apt package 

The choice of which to use is dependant on the specific setup of your computer but the following guidelines should help you make a decision:

1. If your Python editor has a "package installation" tool, it is recommended that you use it to install modules. In some instances this may be the only mechanism for installing packages for use in your editor. [Instructions for many popular Python editors are in the next step](link to step).
2. If you are using a Raspberry Pi computer with the Raspberry Pi OS (Raspbian), it is recommended you [install packages with the pip3 command line utility](link to step).
3. If you have installed a Full Python installation (from python.org) with either the IDLE editor or another standalone IDE, it is recommended you [use the pip3 command line utility](link to).
4. If a package is not available on pypi.org, you should refer to the moduleâ€™s install instructions for more information. Operating System specific installers may be available, or you may be able to install the module using the source code (advanced).
