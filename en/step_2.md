## Installing packages

The most common methods for installing packages are:

+ The tool provided with your Python editor
+ The `pip` / `pip3` command line utility, which is included with a full Python install
+ An operating system specific–installer provided by the package creators (e.g. a Windows installer or Debian apt package) 

The choice of which to use is dependant on the specific set up of your computer but the following guidelines should help you make a decision:

1. If your Python editor has a **package installation tool**, we recommend that you use this. 

    Note: using the package installation tool maybe the only way to install modules for use in your editor. Normally, modules installed using the editor's tool are only be available to you within the editor itself.

2. If you are using a Raspberry Pi computer with the Raspberry Pi OS (Raspbian), we recommend you [install packages with the pip3 command line utility](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/install-python-packages/3).

3. If you have a full Python installation (from [python.org](https://python.org)) and are using either the IDLE editor or a another stand-alone IDE, we recommend you [install packages with the pip3 command line utility](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/install-python-packages/3).

If a package is not available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org), refer to the module’s install instructions for more information. Operating system–specific installers may be available, or you may be able to install the module using the source code (this is an advanced approach).
