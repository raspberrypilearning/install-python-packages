## Using Python editor package installation tools

Online and dedicated editors usually come with "pre-installed packages" or have their own package installers which can be used to install additional packages.

You can find out more about online and dedicated editors in our [Python install options](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/python-install-options) guidance.

Below is guidance regarding some of the popular online and installed Python editors. If your editor is not listed, be sure to check out their documentation.

### trinket.io

[trinket.io comes with some python modules pre-installed](https://trinket.io/docs/python) which you can use without having to install them yourself. There is no option to install additional packages if the module you wish to use is not available.

### repl.it

The repl.it Packages feature can be used to add additional modules to your project. Due to the limitations of all online editors not all modules will work, however many will.

### Thonny
