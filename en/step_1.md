## What is a Python package

A Python package is a container for a module or collection of modules. To use a module in your programs its package must be installed.

You are using a module every time you use an `import` in your program. e.g.

```python
from time import sleep
import numpy as np
import pygame
```

[The Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) is a collection of modules which are "inbuilt" with Python (e.g `time`, `random`, `os`) and do not need installing. 

Additional modules must be installed using their "package". These modules may have been created by organisations, teams or individuals. The number of "additional" modules far exceeds the number of inbuilt modules.

Most packages are made available on the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org).

Whether you can install a package will depend on:

- how you are using Python on your computer
- if and how you installed Python
- your level of access to change your computer's setup

You may wish to review our guidance regarding [Python install options](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/python-install-options) for more information on the options creating Python programs.

This guide provides guidance and advice on how to install Python packages for the most typical scenarios. However, not all scenarios can be catered for and your specific set-up may affect your ability to install or use a specific python package.

Raspberry Pi Foundation projects, courses and resources will describe what python packages you will need in order to complete the activity and any known issues or limitations.
